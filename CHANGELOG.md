# Changelog

All notable changes to the viibeware Corp. website.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Default admin password changed from `viibeware2026` to `admin`.** Fresh installs must set a new password on first login before the rest of the admin unlocks. Existing deploys with `ADMIN_PASS` already set in `.env` are unaffected — only installs actually using the default password are prompted.

### Added
- **Forced password change on first login** — when a user logs in with the default password, the session is flagged and every admin page redirects to `/admin/change-password` until a new password is set.
- **Voluntary password change** — "Change password" link in the sidebar footer. Requires current password.
- **Strong-password rule** — minimum 12 characters, must include uppercase, lowercase, and a digit. Rejects the default value itself.
- Hashed-password storage in `data/auth.json` (scrypt, via `werkzeug.security`). Once a hash is stored it takes precedence over the `ADMIN_PASS` env var.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Per-product logo and title sizing** — new `logo_size` (px) and `title_size` (px) fields, editable from the product's Core tab. Title size of 0 keeps the responsive `clamp()` default.
- **Auto-fetched versions from GitHub** — each product can now be configured with `github_repo` and `version_source` (`manual` / `github_release` / `github_tag`). A daemon thread refreshes every 6 hours with a cross-worker cooldown so multiple gunicorn workers don't duplicate requests. Optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var raises the rate limit to 5000/hr.
- New admin endpoints: `POST /admin/products/<id>/refresh-version` (single product) and `POST /admin/refresh-versions` (bulk).
- Product edit Core tab: inline "⟳ Refresh" button next to the version field; "Last fetched" timestamp.

### Changed
- **Navigation icon picker** — replaced the free-text "icon" field on the Navigation page with a dropdown (Text link / GitHub icon / Docker Hub icon).

---

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Complete admin UI rewrite** — multi-page layout with a persistent sidebar, one URL per editable area. Replaces the prior single-page collapsible admin.
- **Dynamic products** — schema now stores `products` as an array. Add/remove products from the admin; each product gets its own edit page with tabs for Core, Media, Features &amp; tech, Repo links, and Install.
- **Unlimited screenshots, features, repo links, install tabs, and install steps** — all lists support add/remove and drag-to-reorder.
- `repo_links` and `install_tabs` changed from keyed objects to ordered lists of `{id, label, url/icon/..., enabled, ...}`; flat step arrays (`docker_steps`, `quickrun_steps`, `install_steps`) are folded into their corresponding tab's `steps` list.
- `sections` entries now carry `type` (hero / about / product / install) and `product_id` instead of being matched by hardcoded id.
- Public `index.html` now iterates sections generically and looks products up by id — no more hardcoded product blocks.
- Legacy admin endpoints removed: `/admin/update/<section>` (replaced by per-area POST handlers such as `/admin/hero`, `/admin/about`, `/admin/products/<id>`, etc.).

### Added
- Automatic startup migration: `product` + `product3` are reshaped into `products[]`, keyed repo/install structures become lists, and sections gain `type`/`product_id`. Snapshot is saved to `data/content.pre-products-migration-<timestamp>.json` before writing.
- `/admin/products` list view with inline create/delete.
- Login page redesigned to match the new admin visual system.

### Fixed
- Products migration now writes the reshaped JSON back to disk (previously the migration ran in memory without persisting).

## [0.2.2] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **User content fully decoupled from the container image.** User uploads now live under `static/uploads/` (volume-mounted, `.dockerignore`-excluded, never baked in). `static/img/` is now reserved for chrome assets (`logo.svg`, `og-image.png`) that ship with the app and update on deploy.
- Docker volume `viibeware-uploads` now mounts at `/app/static/uploads` (previously `/app/static/img`).
- Admin footer link goes to `/admin` and redirects to login only if the session has expired.

### Added
- Automatic startup migration: rewrites legacy `img/X` content references to `uploads/X` where the file is present in uploads; snapshots the prior content.json to `data/content.pre-uploads-migration-<timestamp>.json`.
- Import now accepts both `img/` (legacy) and `uploads/` zip entries and normalizes paths on the way in.

---

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Backup / Restore** — new Backup admin section with Export (downloads `content.json` + all images as a single zip) and Import (restores from a backup zip, validates JSON, snapshots pre-import content)
- **Trusted Servants Pro** product section with Docker Compose and `install.sh` install paths
- `/admin/export` and `/admin/import` routes (admin-only, zip-slip protected)

### Changed
- Session cookie renamed to `viibeware_session` to prevent collision with other Flask apps sharing the same host
- `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` bumped to 200 MB to accommodate full-site backup zips
- Admin XHR auth failures return JSON 401 (instead of silent 302 to login) so the UI can surface a clear error
- Install tabs scoped to their own section so switching tabs in one product doesn't collapse another
- Header navigation simplified to four items (Garage Logbook, Trusted Servants Pro, GitHub icon, Docker Hub icon); snarky/sarcastic copy removed
- Removed stats/metrics/testimonials/Warehouse Manager sections

### Fixed
- Session cookie dropped on admin POSTs when another Flask app on the same host set its own `session` cookie

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Added comprehensive field migration in `load_content()` — auto-backfills `repo_links`, `featured_image`, `logo`, `screenshots`, `quickrun_steps`, `install_tabs`, `bluesky`, and converts legacy flat-string footer fields to structured objects
